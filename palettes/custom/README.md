LPC Sprite CUSTOM Character Palettes
=============================================

Custom Palettes are for specific assets that may have one or more unique colors. This is only for assets which existed prior to making standardized palettes so we keep the original palette even with the recolors. I'll provide a list of asset palettes here to address which ones belong to where.


#### 1. ulpc-horn-palettes.json
- Path: spritesheets/head/horns
- Combines cloth, metal, and body palettes, along with a custom "horns" palette
- Possibility: I considered adding a "wood" palette from one of the bows. I opted against this for now but I think it'd be a cool idea.

#### 2. ulpc-mask-palettes.json
- Path: spritesheets/facial/masks/plain
- Combines cloth and metal palettes, along with custom "dark" and "light" palettes (possibly we could just stick with black/white from the cloth palettes but I wanted to keep the originals for legacy purposes)
- Possibility: I considered adding a "wood" palette from one of the bows. I opted against this for now but I think it'd be a cool idea.

#### 3. ulpc-glasses-monocle-palettes.json
- Path: spritesheets/facial/glasses/round
- Path: spritesheets/facial/glasses/sunglasses
- Path: spritesheets/facial/monocle/left/frame
- Path: spritesheets/facial/monocle/right/frame
- Combines cloth and metal palettes, along with custom "base" and "sunglasses" that are used in the round glasses, sunglasses (which are just a dark version of round glasses), as well as the frame for the monocle (which is based on the round glasses, or perhaps the monocle came first, not sure which). I opted to combine the brown and sunglasses palettes into one, though its possible we might not need either as the colors are similar to other colors. Still, I kept the original colors for legacy purposes.

#### 4. ulpc-eyepatch-palettes.json
- Path: spritesheets/facial/patches/eyepath
- Just a variation of the "cloth" palettes but including the original base palette from the original eyepatch sprites.

#### 5. ulpc-eyepatch-small-palettes.json
- Path: spritesheets/facial/patches/small
- Just a variation of the "cloth" palettes but including the original base palette from the original "patch" sprite, which I renamed into "small eyepatch".

#### 6. ulpc-bandana-palettes.json
- Path: spritesheets/hat/bandana
- Path: spritesheets/hat/bandana2
- Just a variation of the "cloth" palettes but including the original base bandana sprite palette (red, grey, white).

#### 7. ulpc-crown-palettes.json
- Path: spritesheets/hat/crown
- Just a variation of the "cloth" palettes but including the original base crown sprite palettes ().

#### 8. ulpc-hood-palettes.json
- Path: spritesheets/hat/hood
- Converts one of the hood palettes to each other between all 13 core colors, not including the partial translucent colors.

#### 9. ulpc-hijab-palettes.json
- Path: spritesheets/hat/cloth/hijab
- Just a variation of the "cloth" palettes but including the original base palette from hijab.

#### 10. ulpc-formal-hat-palettes.json
- Path: spritesheets/hat/formal
- Just a variation of the "cloth" palettes but including the original base palettes from formal hats.

#### 11. ulpc-magic-hat-palettes.json
- Path: spritesheets/hat/magic
- Just a variation of the "cloth" palettes but including the original base palettes from standard magic hats (not brown_2 or the starry hats).

#### 12. ulpc-formal-hat-belt-palettes.json
- Path: spritesheets/hat/formal
- Just a variation of the "cloth" palettes but including the original base belt palettes from formal hats (not brown_2 or the starry hats).

#### 13. ulpc-formal-hat-buckle-palettes.json
- Path: spritesheets/hat/formal
- Just a variation of the "metal" palettes with the override color from the magic hat buckle as the base color.

#### 14. ulpc-pirate-trim-palettes.json
- Path: spritesheets/hat/pirate
- Just a variation of the "cloth and metal" palettes including the original base color of the captain hat trim in the pirate hats.
- NOTE: The original "silver" and "bronze" trim variations are still present--they're just "steel" and "copper" instead of silver and bronze. The "gold" variant is technically just using bronze as well, but darker shades of bronze.
- The "base" color present I thoutght was the "gold" repalette, but it appears to actually be different. It doesn't match any existing palette, which is why I kept this as a separate color.

#### 15. ulpc-pirate-cockade-palettes.json
- Path: spritesheets/hat/pirate/bicorne/admiral/cockade
- Just a variation of the "cloth" palettes including the original base color of the admiral hat's "cockade".

#### 16. ulpc-formal-pants-palettes.json
- Path: spritesheets/legs/formal
- Path: spritesheets/legs/formal_striped
- Just a variation of the "cloth" palettes including the original base color of the "formal" pants.
